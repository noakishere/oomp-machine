# oomp machine

## Overview

the **oomp machine** is a web-based synthesizer and sequencer that harnesses the mathematical beauty of Euclidean rhythms to generate dynamic and evolving rhythmic patterns.

## Concept

At its core, oomp machine uses the principle of Euclidean rhythms; distributing a given number of beats as evenly as possible across a sequence to create complex and organic patterns. These patterns, which are fundamental in various world music traditions, are reimagined through algorithmic processes in this digital instrument.
